# RelativeRotation

RRGÂ® charts show you the relative strength and momentum for a group of stocks. Stocks with strong relative strength and momentum appear in the green Leading quadrant. 
As relative momentum fades, they typically move into the yellow Weakening quadrant. If relative strength then fades, they move into the red Lagging quadrant. 
Finally, when momentum starts to pick up again, they shift into the blue Improving quadrant.
